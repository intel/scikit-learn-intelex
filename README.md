With Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn you can accelerate your Scikit-learn applications and still have full conformance with all Scikit-Learn APIs and algorithms. This is a **free software AI accelerator** that brings over **10-100X** acceleration across a variety of applications. And you do not even need to change the existing code!

## How it works?

Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn offers you a way to accelerate existing scikit-learn code.
The acceleration is achieved through **patching**: replacing the stock scikit-learn algorithms with their optimized versions provided by the extension.

One of the ways to patch scikit-learn is by modifying the code. First, you import an additional Python package (`sklearnex`) and enable optimizations via `sklearnex.patch_sklearn()`. Then import scikit-learn estimators:

- **Enable Intel CPU optimizations**

    ```py
    import numpy as np
    from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
    patch_sklearn()

    from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

    X = np.array([[1., 2.], [2., 2.], [2., 3.],
                [8., 7.], [8., 8.], [25., 80.]], dtype=np.float32)
    clustering = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=2).fit(X)
    ```

- **Enable Intel GPU optimizations**

    ```py
    import numpy as np
    import dpctl
    from sklearnex import patch_sklearn, config_context
    patch_sklearn()

    from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

    X = np.array([[1., 2.], [2., 2.], [2., 3.],
                [8., 7.], [8., 8.], [25., 80.]], dtype=np.float32)
    with config_context(target_offload="gpu:0"):
        clustering = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=2).fit(X)
    ```

üëÄ Read about [other ways to patch scikit-learn](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/index.html#usage) and [other methods for offloading to GPU devices](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/oneapi-gpu.html).
Check out available [notebooks](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex/tree/master/examples/notebooks) for more examples.

This software acceleration is achieved through the use of vector instructions, IA hardware-specific memory optimizations, threading, and optimizations for all upcoming Intel platforms at launch time.

## Supported Algorithms

‚ùó The patching only affects [selected algorithms and their parameters](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/algorithms.html).

You may still use algorithms and parameters not supported by Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn in your code. You will not get an error if you do this. When you use algorithms or parameters not supported by the extension, the package fallbacks into original stock version of scikit-learn.

## üöÄ Acceleration

## üõ† Installation

[System Requirements](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/system-requirements.html)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Install via pip or conda](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex/blob/master/INSTALL.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Build from sources](INSTALL.md#build-from-sources)

Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn is available at the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn-intelex/),
on Anaconda Cloud in [Conda-Forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scikit-learn-intelex) and in [Intel channel](https://anaconda.org/intel/scikit-learn-intelex). You can also build the extension from [sources](INSTALL.md#build-from-sources).

The extension is also available as a part of [Intel¬Æ AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html)‚ÄØ(AI Kit). If you already have AI Kit installed, you do not need to install the extension.

Installation via `pip` package manager is recommended by default:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn-intelex
```

‚ö†Ô∏èIntel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn contains scikit-learn patching functionality that was originally available in [**daal4py**](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex/tree/master/daal4py) package. All future updates for the patches will be available only in Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn. We recommend you to use scikit-learn-intelex package instead of daal4py.
You can learn more about daal4py in [daal4py documentation](https://intelpython.github.io/daal4py).
