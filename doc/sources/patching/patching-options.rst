.. important::

    These patching methods are interchangeable.
    They support different enabling scenarios while producing the same result.

- Without editing the code of a scikit-learn application by using the following command line flag::

    python -m sklearnex my_application.py

- Directly from the script::

    from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
    patch_sklearn()

.. important::

    You have to import scikit-learn **after** these lines. Otherwise, the patching will not affect the original scikit-learn estimators.

- Through importing the desired estimator from the sklearnex module in your script::

    from sklearnex.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

- Through :ref:`global patching <global_patching>` to enable patching for your scikit-learn installation for all further runs::

    python sklearnex.glob patch_sklearn
