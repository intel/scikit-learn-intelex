Acceleration Details
####################

The performance of some algorithms changes based on the parameters that are used.
This section denotes the details of such cases.

Refer to :ref:`sklearn_algorithms` to see the full list of algorithms, parameters, and data formats supported in |intelex|.

.. _acceleration_tsne:

TSNE
----

TSNE algorithm consists of two components: KNN and Gradient Descent.
The overall accelration of TSNE depends on the acceleration of each of these algorithms.

- The KNN part of the algorithm supports all parameters except:
 
  - ``metric`` != `'euclidean'` or `'minkowski'` with ``p`` != `2`
- The Gradient Descent part of the algorithm supports all parameters except:
 
  - ``n_components`` = `3`
  - ``method`` = `'exact'`
  - ``verbose`` != `0`

To get better performance, use parameters supported by both components.
