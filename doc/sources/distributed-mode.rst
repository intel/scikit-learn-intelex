Distributed Mode
================

|intelex| offers Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) supported interfaces for distributed computing.
Several `GPU-supported algorithms <https://uxlfoundation.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/latest/oneapi-gpu.html#>`_ 
also provide distributed, multi-GPU computing capabilities via integration with ``mpi4py``. The prerequisites 
match those of GPU computing, along with an MPI backend of your choice (`Intel MPI recommended 
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/mpi-library.html#gs.dcan6r>`_, available 
via ``impi-devel`` python package) and the ``mpi4py`` python package. If using |intelex| 
`installed from sources <https://github.com/uxlfoundation/scikit-learn-intelex/blob/main/INSTALL.md#build-from-sources>`_,
ensure that the spmd_backend is built.

Note that |intelex| now supports GPU offloading to speed up MPI operations. This is supported automatically with 
some MPI backends, but in order to use GPU offloading with Intel MPI, set the following environment variable (providing
data on device without this may lead to a runtime error):
 
::

     export I_MPI_OFFLOAD=1

Estimators can be imported from the ``sklearnex.spmd`` module. Data should be distributed across multiple nodes as 
desired, and should be transfered to a dpctl or dpnp array before being passed to the estimator. View a full 
example of this process in the |intelex| repository, where many examples of our SPMD-supported estimators are 
available: https://github.com/uxlfoundation/scikit-learn-intelex/blob/main/examples/sklearnex/. To run:

::

  mpirun -n 4 python linear_regression_spmd.py

Note that additional mpirun arguments can be added as desired. SPMD-supported estimators are listed in the 
`algorithms support documentation <https://uxlfoundation.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/latest/algorithms.html#spmd-support>`_.

Additionally, daal4py offers some distributed functionality, see 
`documentation <https://intelpython.github.io/daal4py/scaling.html>`_ for further details.
