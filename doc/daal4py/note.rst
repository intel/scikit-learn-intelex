.. _note:

.. note:: Scikit-learn patching functionality in daal4py was deprecated and moved to a separate package, `Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn* <https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex>`_. 
                All future patches will be available only in Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn*. Use the scikit-learn-intelex package instead of daal4py for the scikit-learn acceleration.
