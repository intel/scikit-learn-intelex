# This file lists node ids (in pytest sense) of sklearn tests that
# are to be deselected during test discovery step.
#
# Deselection can be predicated on the version of scikit-learn used.
# Use - node_id cond, or - node_id cond1,cond2  where cond is OPver.
# Supported OPs are >=, <=, ==, !=, >, <
# For example,
#    - tests/test_isotonic.py::test_permutation_invariance >0.18,<=0.19
#  will exclude deselection in versions 0.18.1, and 0.18.2 only

  # For Newton-CG solver, solution computed in float32 disagrees with that of float64 a little more than
  # the test expects, see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13645
