# The purpose of this helper script is to be able to execute
# different shell commands according to whether the process
# is the first MPI rank or not. It works by passing it the
# arguments to a pytest call with the json report arguments
# from an mpirun/mpiexec invocation - e.g.
#     mpirun -n 2 helper_mpi_tests.py pytest <args to pytest>
